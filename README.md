## About the Community

Struggling to find good coding resources? Learning DSA & front-end shouldn’t feel like a never-ending search. That’s why I built **StudyURL** – a simple, clean platform that collects the best study links in one place.

💡 **No more random Googling. No more outdated tutorials.** Just high-quality, handpicked resources to help you learn faster & smarter.
